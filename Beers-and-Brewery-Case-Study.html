<h4>After observing the bar plots and the heat maps, The conclussion I would make is that though the the west coast has a higher density of breweries, the beers produced in the east coast seems to have higher levels of alcohol and bitterness. The correlation shows that the ABV and IBU have a positive correlation, and that explains the heat maps and the bar plots. In the first bar plot and heat map we can see that there are more breweries in the west coast, and they mostly produce beers with comperatively lower levels of ABV and IBU. The oposite can be seen on the east coast, concluding that the places with least breweries in them tend to produce beers with higher levels of ABV and IBU.</h4>
