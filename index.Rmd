# Hello all!

### I am Leo, a student in the SMU's Master of Science in Data Science program!

### I did my undergraduate work at Texas A&M University - Commerce, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and a second major in Mathematics.

### I am currently working at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas.

### I was born in Brazil so, as a typical Brazilian, my favorite hobby is playing soccer.  I also enjoy watching movies and playing video games.

### The other tabs represent work/analyses that I have completed.  Please check them out!
